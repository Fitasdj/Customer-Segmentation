# Customer-Segmentation : Perks Analysis Enhancing Customer Experience
The focus of this project is segmenting customers based on their shopping behavior. However, it is important to know that segmentation is a very general approach to data analysis that is broadly applicable to just about every domain. Whenever we suspect a dataset has some natural but hidden structure, we can use segmentation to reveal it.
## Introduction:
In response to the dynamic landscape of the travel industry, we initiated an in-depth analysis of the Perks Program. The primary goal was to assess the performance and popularity of individual perks, with a focus on aligning offerings with customer preferences.


## Objective:
The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness and popularity of perks within our Perks Program. We aimed to understand customer preferences, identify high-performing perks, and provide recommendations for optimization.


## Methodology:
The analysis employed a two-fold approach. Firstly, customer data was meticulously categorized based on demographic characteristics such as age group and geographic location. Secondly, thresholding, fuzzy, and K-means segmentation methods were implemented to rank customers and determine their affinity for specific perks.

# Key Findings:
- Free cancellation fee: This perk garnered the highest customer interest, indicating its significance in enhancing the travel experience.
- Free hotel meals and checked bags: These perks also demonstrated strong appeal, suggesting they should be prominently featured in marketing efforts.
- One Night Free Hotel with Flight: Optimization opportunities exist to further increase its adoption among qualified customers.
- Exclusive Discounts: Targeted marketing towards specific customer groups can amplify the attractiveness of exclusive discounts.
