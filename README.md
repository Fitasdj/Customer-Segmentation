# Customer-Segmentation 
The focus of this project is segmenting customers based on their shopping behavior. However, it is important to know that segmentation is a very general approach to data analysis that is broadly applicable to just about every domain. Whenever we suspect a dataset has some natural but hidden structure, we can use segmentation to reveal it.

## Introduction
In response to the dynamic landscape of the travel industry, we initiated an in-depth analysis of the Perks Program. The primary goal was to assess the performance and popularity of individual perks, with a focus on aligning offerings with customer preferences.


## Objective
The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness and popularity of perks within our Perks Program. We aimed to understand customer preferences, identify high-performing perks, and provide recommendations for optimization.


## Methodology
The analysis employed a two-fold approach. Firstly, customer data was meticulously categorized based on demographic characteristics such as age group and geographic location. Secondly, thresholding, fuzzy, and K-means segmentation methods were implemented to rank customers and determine their affinity for specific perks.
